**** Introduction ****
----------------------

The DHTP (DOOM High-resolution Texture Project) is a community driven project that had is birth as the D2RP (Doom 2 Retexture project). That project initially had a good start, but was unfortunately misguided during the course of its development, and couldn't realistically be rescued without a lot of attention. Thus, JDTP (jdoom texture pack) came into being (Thanks to Chilvence). To repair the damage and salvage what could be salvaged.
Now it has grown into the DHTP (Doom Hires Texture Project) which is a continuation of the JDTP but with all high resolution texture capable ports in mind.

The main goal of the DHTP is to provide the community with a space to easily contribute their own works, as well as offering a steady stream of feedback from both site visitors and administrators. It will also be a lot more tightly controlled than its predescessor, in regards to both copyrights and quality control.

**** Participation ****
-----------------------

If you are intrested in joining in, head over to the DHTP website (http://dhtp.freelanzer.com/). Where you can access the blog, bug tracker(You don't need to register to post bugs), and forums. On registering on the forum, you will then be able to post up your new textures so the texture pack admin can add it to the pack (if they are better than currents ones or if they do not exist yet). There are a few important rules that I will outline here:

1. Anything you submit MUST be entirely your own work or modifications of permission granted DHTP textures. You may not submit modifications of original id textures, as this constitutes copyright infringement.

2. Only PNG images can be uploaded. This keeps the size down and the quality flawless. A more detailed look at PNG files can be found here: http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/

3. Public domain textures, (while not preffered) may be submitted, as long as a link is given to the site they were obtained.
